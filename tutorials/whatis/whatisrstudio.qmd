title: "What is RStudio"
---

To use R, you write code. These are lines of text that tell the computer
what to do with your data. You can run code in the R console, but most
people use it through RStudio. RStudio is a friendly interface that
makes coding easier.

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes coding much easier. It helps you to:

-   Write, organize and run your R code mode efficiently

-   View your data, code and results in one place

-   Create plots, manage files and install packages

-   Get useful hints as you type (like autocomplete and error messages)

You still need to have R installed, because RStudio runs on top of R, it doesn't replace it. But once both are installed, RStudio becomes the main way most people work with R. 

RStudio is developed by a company called Posit (formerly known as RStudio Inc.). RStudio is available for free on their website.
